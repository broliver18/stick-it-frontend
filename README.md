# Stick-It

## Description
This app was intended for teachers to use with their students and works similarly to Kahoot. The teacher can create quizzes with both multiple-choice and short-answer questions. They can then host a game for that quiz which the students can join via generated PIN. 

Unlike Kahoot, this game is self-paced, meaning that not all users have to answer a question simultaneously. Instead of the question showing up on the host's screen, it will show up on the user's screen. If a user answers a question correctly, they will be allowed to flip 1 of 24 possible cards. The back of the card consists of the number of points (which can be negative) that will be awarded to the user (the host will determine the range of possible points when creating the quiz).

The host's screen will display the current rankings for all users playing which will include their name and how many points they have. This display will be updated in real-time as users answer questions.

This app can be used by people of all ages but will likely be more entertaining for younger users (age 12 and under). The self-paced nature of the game allows teachers to create a fun game in which students of all abilities can take their time to answer without feeling pressured. Additionally, the point system allows for an added layer of excitement and unpredictability due to not knowing how many points are behind each card.
